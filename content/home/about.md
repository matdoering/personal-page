# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate at Saarland Informatics Campus where I'm investigating computational approaches for improving treatment and prevention of viral infections. This research resulted in three bioinformatic tools: [openPrimeR](http://openprimer.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), <a href = "https://ngs.geno2pheno.org/">geno2pheno[ngs-freq]</a>, and <a href = "https://coreceptor-hiv2.geno2pheno.org/">geno2pheno[coreceptor-hiv2]</a>. I hold a BSc and MSc in Bioinformatics from Saarland University. In my
bachelor's and master's thesis I used supervised learning for viral genotyping and methylation profiling. In my free time I like to blog about [applying data science in R](https://www.datascienceblog.net).
