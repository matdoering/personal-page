# Biography

I am currently working as a software architect/developer at DB Systel where I'm supporting the digitalization of the German railway system. Previously, I completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics where I researched [computational methods for improving treatment and prevention of viral infections](computational_approaches_doering_2019.pdf).
