I'm frequently writing posts on [datascienceblog.net, a blog about everything related to data science and programming](https://www.datascienceblog.net).
I've also contributed an article about [the historic popularity of supervised learning models to KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/12/supervised-learning-model-popularity-from-past-present.html)
