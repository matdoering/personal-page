# Abstract and optional shortened version.
    abstract = """Human immunodeficiency virus–2 (HIV-2) is endemic in some countries in West Africa. Due to the lower prevalence in industrialized countries, there is limited experience and knowledge on the management of individuals living with HIV-2 in Europe. Compared to HIV-1, there are differential characteristics of HIV-2 regarding diagnostic procedures, the clinical course, and, most importantly, antiretroviral therapy.

We integrated the published literature on HIV-2 (studies and reports on epidemiology, diagnostics, the clinical course, and treatment), as well as expert experience in diagnosing and clinical care, to provide recommendations for a present standard of medical care of those living with HIV-2 in Western European countries, including an overview of strategies for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, with suggestions for effective drug combinations for first- and second-line treatments,
post-exposure prophylaxis, and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as listings of mutations related to HIV-2 drug resistance and C-C motif chemokine receptor type 5 and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4 coreceptor tropism."""
