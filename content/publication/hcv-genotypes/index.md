HCV affects 185 million people worldwide and leads to death and morbidities. HCV has a high genetic diversity and is classified into seven genotypes and 67 subtypes. Novel anti-HCV drugs (Direct-Acting-Antivirals) eligibility, resistance and cure rates depend on HCV geno/subtype (GT).

Objectives

Analysis of epidemiological information and viral GT from patients undergoing viral genotyping in 2011–2015.

Study design

Anonymized information from 52 centers was analyzed retrospectively.

Results

37,839 samples were included in the study. We show that the GT distribution is similar throughout Western European countries, with some local differences. Here GTs 1 and 2 prevalences are lower and of GT4 higher than in all previous reports. Israel has a unique GT pattern and in South Russia the GT proportions are more similar to Asia. GTs 5 and 6 were detected in very low proportions. Three cases of the recombinant genotype P were reported in Munich (Germany).

In addition, we observed that GT proportion was dependant on patientś gender, age and transmission route: GTs 1b and 2 were significantly more common in female, older, nosocomially-infected patients, while GTs 1a, 3 and 4 were more frequent in male, younger patients infected by tattooing, drug consume, and/or sexual practices. In infections acquired by drug consume, GTs 1a (35.0%) and 3 (28.1%) prevailed. In infections related to sexual practices lower proportion of GT3 (14.0%) and higher of GT4 (20.2%) were detected. GT4 was mostly abundant in MSM (29.6%). HIV coinfection was significantly associated with higher proportions GTs 1a and 4 (42.5% and 19.3%, respectively).

Conclusion

Genotype prevalence evolves and correlates to epidemiological factors. Continuous surveillance is necessary to better assess hepatitis C infection in Europe and to take appropriate actions."""
